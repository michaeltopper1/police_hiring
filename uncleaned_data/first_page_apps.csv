Sharman - Webb Yes No HOURS PER WEEK: # OF EMPLOYEES SUPERVISED: 40 0 DUTIES: As a pharmacy technician my duties are filling prescriptions for patients and taking in prescriptions from doctor's offices. These prescriptions can come straight from the doctor's office or from a patient. I must verify the identification of patients picking up their prescriptions and record their information for every pick up. My job requires me to handle controlled substances which are drugs that can be highly abused and addictive. These controlled drugs are classified as C2-C5s, I am required to double check quantity, identification of the person picking it up, and verification of the drugs. Along with maintaining the drugs in our pharmacy, we must keep patients' information stored in our computer systems. We must maintain our patients' information confidential and make sure the patient only knows about their medications. As a technician I help patients with any questions about their medication and inform them about any effects they might experience while taking the medication. Being in a pharmacy I must contact insurance companies if medications are rejected and fix the issue if possible. I am constantly on the computer typing prescriptions, verifying information on the scripts and contacting insurance companies to make sure patient's prescriptions are covered. Some of my accomplishments from work are owning a Kentucky state pharmacist technician license, which allows me to work and fill prescriptions in the state of Kentucky. This license represents the sign of trust I have earned from my hard work at Walgreens and knowing my co-workers can count on me. I constantly answer patients' questions about their medication which has enhanced my communication skills. The computer program in my pharmacy which is used for filing and typing prescriptions has expanded my knowledge on various computer applications. The computer program allows me to search patients' private information, social security numbers, date of births, addresses, insurance companies they use, doctors they have seen, and medications that have used in the past. I have also worked in all departments in the Walgreens store, which would include: photo technician, floor person, and a cashier. I have closed the cashier drawers at the end of work days and balanced them into our computer system.
